#Waste Classification Using Machine Learning

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of waste into categories such as recyclable, organic, and general waste. The goal is to assist in automated waste segregation and promote better recycling practices.
 Features
 
CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras

Image preprocessing and data augmentation
Model evaluation with accuracy and loss visualization
Can be extended to real-time classification with webcam or API

The dataset used consists of images of waste items categorized into two types such as:

Organic
Non Organic
